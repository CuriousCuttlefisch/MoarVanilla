Moar Vanilla is a small mod for Minecraft.

I wanted a simple mod that added only things that would blend well with vanilla Minecraft, such as slabs and stairs for vanilla blocks that don't yet have their own. This is my attempt at creating such a mod. Expect similarities with the Quark mod, because it was also designed with that purpose in mind. I felt that some of the additions from the Quark mod didn't quite fit with vanilla Minecraft, though, so I decided to work on my own minimalistic mod.
