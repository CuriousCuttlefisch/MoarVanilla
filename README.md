Moar Vanilla is a small mod for Minecraft.

I wanted a simple mod that added only things that would blend well with vanilla Minecraft, such as slabs and stairs for vanilla blocks that don't yet have their own. This is my attempt at creating such a mod. Expect some similarities with the Quark mod, because it was designed with a similar purpose. I felt that some of the additions from the Quark mod didn't quite fit with the vanilla Minecraft feel, though, so I decided to work on my own minimalistic mod.
